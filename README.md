# Fsim-HeloCollective
3D-printable STL files and .step file for my flight simulator controls (helicopter collective)
Someone asked for it in [r/hotasdiy](https://www.reddit.com/r/HotasDIY/), so here it is.

This is the result of a lot of trial and error and multiple prototype revisions. 
I have built one working copy, but of course your build will need your own tweaks and adjustments, hence the inclusion of the .step file.

The design hasn't a licence agreement because I can't be bothered to choose/write one. Do whatever you like with the design.
The construction is very straightforward , but making sure the parts are aligned and not warped are important to prevent binding and stiction problems.
I wish you luck, but I can't really offer any other support. 

I don't have a BOM. If you want to build this as it it presented here, you'll need:
* 6807 Ball bearings (2),
* P3022-v1-CW360 Angle sensor(1),
* Bansbach FRT-D3-501-G1 v1 rotary damper (1)
* Arduino board (I used a micro clone) (1)
* Miscellaneous wiring and stuff.

The arduino code is very sketchy (pardon the pun), but works generally. I lost the source in a drive failure, but if I can find a copy of it I'll add it to the project files.
